			<b>&bull; What is this?</b>
			<p>The Torrey Chemistry Tournament is a competition that was started by a couple of high school students that are interested in chemistry. All pre-collegiate students are allowed to take the exam.</p>
			<b>&bull; Neat - how do I get started?</b>
			<p>When one of the testing windows opens, you can download the test. Before the same testing window closes, send your submission to <a href="mailto:torreychemistry@gmail.com">torreychemistry@gmail.com</a> with a proper submission title. Learn how the competition works at the competition tab.</p>
			<b>&bull; I'm no good at chemistry, but I like the idea!</b>
			<p>Great! We're looking for supporters. We'd also like to provide prizes to the top scorers, but for now we can only place them on a Hall of Fame. If you have any ideas or resources for improvement - whether it be in website design, problem writing, or anything else - send us an email!</p>
